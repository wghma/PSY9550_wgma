-   Chapter 1: 2E1-2E4, 2M1-2M3

## Easy 2E1-2E4

2E1. Which of the expressions below correspond to the statement: the probability of rain on Monday?

(1) Pr(rain)
(2) [**Pr(rain\|Monday)**]{.underline} \<-- Probability of rain conditional that the day is a Monday.
(3) Pr(Monday\|rain)
(4) Pr(rain, Monday)= Pr(Monday)

2E2. Which of the following statements corresponds to the expression: Pr(Monday\|rain)?

1.  \(1\) The probability of rain on Monday.

2.  \(2\) The probability of rain, given that it is Monday.

3.  [**(3) The probability that it is Monday, given that it is raining.**]{.underline} \<-- Probability that the day is a Monday conditional that it is raining.

4.  \(4\) The probability that it is Monday and that it is raining.

2E3. Which of the expressions below correspond to the statement: the probability that it is Monday, given that it is raining?

-   **(1) Pr(Monday\|rain)** \<-- Probability of the day being a Monday conditional that it is raining.

-   \(2\) Pr(rain\|Monday)

-   \(3\) Pr(rain\|Monday) Pr(Monday)

-   **(4) Pr(rain\|Monday) Pr(Monday)/ Pr(rain)** \<-- Probability of the day being a Monday conditional that it is raining.

-   \(5\) Pr(Monday\|rain) Pr(rain)/ Pr(Monday)

2E4. The Bayesian statistician Bruno de Finetti (1906–1985) began his book on probability theory with the declaration: “PROBABILITY DOES NOT EXIST.” The capitals appeared in the original, so I imagine de Finetti wanted us to shout this statement. What he meant is that probability is a device for describing uncertainty from the perspective of an observer with limited knowledge; it has no objective reality. Discuss the globe tossing example from the chapter, in light of this statement. What does it mean to say “the probability of water is 0.7”?

Answer: That statement, that p is 0.7 or P(water) = 0.7, might in reality mean that of 1000 global tosses, we could expect that around 700 of them our finger points at water, thought it would be even more useful having a value for the error/variation around this p. What I am wondering of is what his preferred way of conveying expected proportion of water in our global tosses data? By using estimated mean and standard errors?

## Medium 2M1-2M3

2M1. Recall the globe tossing model from the chapter. Compute and plot the grid approximate posterior distribution for each of the following sets of observations. In each case, assume a uniform prior for p.

-   \(1\) W, W, W. uniform prior

```{r, warning = F}

#define grid 
p_grid <- seq( from=0 , to=1 , length.out=20 ) 
# define prior, p for water
prior <- rep( 1 , 20 ) 

# compute likelihood at each value in grid 
n_draws <- 3
n_water <- 3
likelihood <- dbinom(n_water , size=n_draws , prob=p_grid ) # max(dinom|p,n) is at x = n*p

# compute product of likelihood and prior 

unstd.posterior <- likelihood * prior 
# standardize the posterior, so it sums to 1 

posterior <- unstd.posterior / sum(unstd.posterior)

```

```{r, warning = F}
plot( p_grid , posterior , 
      type="b" , 
      xlab="probability of water" , 
      ylab="posterior probability" ) 
mtext( "20 points. Data: WWW" )
```

-   \(2\) W, W, W, L. uniform prior

```{r, warning = F}

#define grid 
p_grid <- seq( from=0 , to=1 , length.out=20 ) 
# define prior, p for water
prior <- rep( 1 , 20 ) 

# compute likelihood at each value in grid 
n_draws <- 4
n_water <- 3
likelihood <- dbinom(n_water , size=n_draws , prob=p_grid ) # max(dinom|p,n) is at x = n*p

# compute product of likelihood and prior 

unstd.posterior <- likelihood * prior 
# standardize the posterior, so it sums to 1 

posterior <- unstd.posterior / sum(unstd.posterior)

```

```{r, warning = F}
plot( p_grid , posterior , 
      type="b" , 
      xlab="probability of water" , 
      ylab="posterior probability" ) 
mtext( "20 points. Data: WWWL" )
```

-   \(3\) L, W, W, L, W, W, W. uniform prior

```{r, warning = F}

#define grid 
p_grid <- seq( from=0 , to=1 , length.out=20 ) 
# define prior, p for water
prior <- rep( 1 , 20 ) 

# compute likelihood at each value in grid 
n_draws <- 7
n_water <- 5
likelihood <- dbinom(n_water , size=n_draws , prob=p_grid ) # max(dinom|p,n) is at x = n*p

# compute product of likelihood and prior 

unstd.posterior <- likelihood * prior 
# standardize the posterior, so it sums to 1 

posterior <- unstd.posterior / sum(unstd.posterior)

```

```{r, warning = F}
plot( p_grid , posterior , 
      type="b" , 
      xlab="probability of water" , 
      ylab="posterior probability" ) 
mtext( "20 points. Data: LWWLWWW" )
```

2M2. Now assume a prior for p that is equal to zero when p \< 0.5 and is a positive constant when p \>= 0.5. Again compute and plot the grid approximate posterior distribution for each of the sets of observations in the problem just above.

-   \(1\) W, W, W. Boolean prior divided at p=0.5

```{r, warning = F}

#define grid 
p_grid <- seq( from=0 , to=1 , length.out=20 ) 
# define prior, p for water
prior <- 1*(p_grid>= 0.5)

# compute likelihood at each value in grid 
n_draws <- 3
n_water <- 3
likelihood <- dbinom(n_water , size=n_draws , prob=p_grid ) # max(dinom|p,n) is at x = n*p

# compute product of likelihood and prior 

unstd.posterior <- likelihood * prior 
# standardize the posterior, so it sums to 1 

posterior <- unstd.posterior / sum(unstd.posterior)

```

```{r, warning = F}
plot( p_grid , posterior , 
      type="b" , 
      xlab="probability of water" , 
      ylab="posterior probability" ) 
mtext( "20 points. Data: WWW. Boolean prior divided at p=0.5" )
```

-   \(2\) W, W, W, L. Boolean prior divided at p=0.5

```{r, warning = F}

#define grid 
p_grid <- seq( from=0 , to=1 , length.out=20 ) 
# define prior, p for water
prior <- 1*(p_grid>= 0.5)

# compute likelihood at each value in grid 
n_draws <- 4
n_water <- 3
likelihood <- dbinom(n_water , size=n_draws , prob=p_grid ) # max(dinom|p,n) is at x = n*p

# compute product of likelihood and prior 

unstd.posterior <- likelihood * prior 
# standardize the posterior, so it sums to 1 

posterior <- unstd.posterior / sum(unstd.posterior)

```

```{r, warning = F}
plot( p_grid , posterior , 
      type="b" , 
      xlab="probability of water" , 
      ylab="posterior probability" ) 
mtext( "20 points. Data: WWWL. Boolean prior divided at p=0.5" )
```

-   \(3\) L, W, W, L, W, W, W –\> Boolean prior divided at p=0.5

```{r, warning = F}

#define grid 
p_grid <- seq( from=0 , to=1 , length.out=20 ) 
# define prior, p for water
prior <- 1*(p_grid>= 0.5)

# compute likelihood at each value in grid 
n_draws <- 7
n_water <- 5
likelihood <- dbinom(n_water , size=n_draws , prob=p_grid ) # max(dinom|p,n) is at x = n*p

# compute product of likelihood and prior 

unstd.posterior <- likelihood * prior 
# standardize the posterior, so it sums to 1 

posterior <- unstd.posterior / sum(unstd.posterior)

```

```{r, warning = F}
plot( p_grid , posterior , 
      type="b" , 
      xlab="probability of water" ,

```

2M3. Suppose there are two globes, one for Earth and one for Mars. The Earth globe is 70% covered in water. The Mars globe is 100% land. Further suppose that one of these globes—you don’t know which—was tossed in the air and produced a “land” observation. Assume that each globe was equally likely to be tossed. Show that the posterior probability that the globe was the Earth, conditional on seeing “land” (Pr(Earth\|land)), is 0.23.

$$
P(Earth|Land) = \dfrac{P(Land|Earth)*P(Earth)}{P(Land)} = \dfrac{0.3*0.5}{\dfrac{1+0.3}{2}} = 0.242 \approx 24\%
$$
